Fixtures overview

This directory contains fixtures organized by tool. Each tool has its own subdirectory under `tests/fixtures/`.

Subdirectories:
- `pdf-to-image/` — fixtures and documentation for the PDF → image tool.
- `datetime-utilities/` — fixtures and documentation for the DateTime tools (timestamps/format tests).

See each tool's README in its subdirectory for details and usage instructions.
